## schedulerFor() function

For custom scheduler with predefined resolution order

Ordering is defined by using a template string like the one generated in case of failure of a [scheduler()](scheduler_1.md)

It may be something like:

```typescript
fc.schedulerFor()`
  -> [task\${2}] promise pending
  -> [task\${3}] promise pending
  -> [task\${1}] promise pending
`

```
Or more generally:

```typescript
fc.schedulerFor()`
  This scheduler will resolve task ${2} first
  followed by ${3} and only then task ${1}
`

```
WARNING: Custom scheduler will neither check that all the referred promises have been scheduled nor that they resolved with the same status and value.

WARNING: If one the promises is wrongly defined it will fail - for instance asking to resolve 5 while 5 does not exist.
