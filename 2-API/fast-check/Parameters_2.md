### asyncReporter

Replace the default reporter handling errors by a custom one

Reporter is responsible to throw in case of failure: default one throws whenever `runDetails.failed` is true. But you may want to change this behaviour in yours.

Only used when calling `fc.assert` Cannot be defined in conjonction with `reporter` Not compatible with synchronous properties: runner will throw

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
asyncReporter?: (runDetails: RunDetails<T>) => Promise<void>;
```

### endOnFailure

Stop run on failure

It makes the run stop at the first encountered failure without shrinking.

When used in complement to `seed` and `path`<!-- -->, it replays only the minimal counterexample.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
endOnFailure?: boolean;
```

### examples

Custom values added at the beginning of generated ones

It enables users to come with examples they want to test at every run

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
examples?: T[];
```

### interruptAfterTimeLimit

Interrupt test execution after a given time limit: disabled by default

NOTE: Relies on `Date.now()`<!-- -->.

NOTE: Useful to avoid having too long running processes in your CI. Replay capability (see , ) can still be used if needed.

WARNING: If the test got interrupted before any failure occured and before it reached the requested number of runs specified by  it will be marked as success. Except if  as been set to `true`

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
interruptAfterTimeLimit?: number;
```

### markInterruptAsFailure

Mark interrupted runs as failed runs: disabled by default

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
markInterruptAsFailure?: boolean;
```

### maxSkipsPerRun

Maximal number of skipped values per run

Skipped is considered globally, so this value is used to compute maxSkips = maxSkipsPerRun \* numRuns. Runner will consider a run to have failed if it skipped maxSkips+1 times before having generated numRuns valid entries.

See [pre](pre.md) for more details on pre-conditions

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
maxSkipsPerRun?: number;
```

### numRuns

Number of runs before success: 100 by default

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
numRuns?: number;
```

### path

Way to replay a failing property directly with the counterexample. It can be fed with the counterexamplePath returned by the failing test (requires `seed` too).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
path?: string;
```

### randomType

Random number generator: `xorshift128plus` by default

Random generator is the core element behind the generation of random values - changing it might directly impact the quality and performances of the generation of random values. It can be one of: 'mersenne', 'congruential', 'congruential32', 'xorshift128plus', 'xoroshiro128plus' Or any function able to build a `RandomGenerator` based on a seed

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
randomType?: RandomType | ((seed: number) => RandomGenerator);
```

### reporter

Replace the default reporter handling errors by a custom one

Reporter is responsible to throw in case of failure: default one throws whenever `runDetails.failed` is true. But you may want to change this behaviour in yours.

Only used when calling `fc.assert` Cannot be defined in conjonction with `asyncReporter`

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
reporter?: (runDetails: RunDetails<T>) => void;
```

### seed

Initial seed of the generator: `Date.now()` by default

It can be forced to replay a failed run.

In theory, seeds are supposed to be 32 bits integers. In case of double value, the seed will be rescaled into a valid 32 bits integer (eg.: values between 0 and 1 will be evenly spread into the range of possible seeds).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
seed?: number;
```

### skipAllAfterTimeLimit

Skip all runs after a given time limit: disabled by default

NOTE: Relies on `Date.now()`<!-- -->.

NOTE: Useful to stop too long shrinking processes. Replay capability (see , ) can resume the shrinking.

WARNING: It skips runs. Thus test might be marked as failed. Indeed, it might not reached the requested number of successful runs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
skipAllAfterTimeLimit?: number;
```

### timeout

Maximum time in milliseconds for the predicate to answer: disabled by default

WARNING: Only works for async code (see ), will not interrupt a synchronous code.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
timeout?: number;
```

### unbiased

Force the use of unbiased arbitraries: biased by default

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
unbiased?: boolean;
```

### verbose

Enable verbose mode: [VerbosityLevel.None](VerbosityLevel/None.md) by default

Using `verbose: true` is equivalent to `verbose: VerbosityLevel.Verbose`

It can prove very useful to troubleshoot issues. See [VerbosityLevel](VerbosityLevel.md) for more details on each level.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
verbose?: boolean | VerbosityLevel;
```
